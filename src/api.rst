API
===

The majority of development around the amiemediator package will center around
the ServiceProvider API, specifically in developing a local service provider
implementation. Documentation supporting this development is in the
:doc:`sp_implementation` section. Documentation for the internals of the
``amie`` application is in the :doc:`internals` section.
